# SpriteKit-Lag-iPhone5

This is a sample project to understand why a simple SpriteKit game is lagging on an iPhone 5 but not on iPhone 6.

I have been working on my first SpriteKit game that perfectly works on iPhone 6 but not on iPhone 5 (iOS 8.2 on both, written in Swift). I explain my problem: there is a simple ball (a SkShapeNode) that bounces when tapping on the screen. The move is very smooth on iPhone 6 but it has some lagging on iPhone 5 but NOT the first time. The FPS is 60 all the time. I have simplified my project a maximum and I have tried everything, I really need your help so much.

Here is the video (smooth the first time then lagging):
